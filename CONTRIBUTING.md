# Contributing

- Open a GitHub issue before large changes.
- Keep PRs small and focused. Include rationale and testing notes.
- Code style:
  - Arduino/C++: 2-space indent, `constexpr` where possible, avoid dynamic allocation.
  - Python: PEP 8, type hints, small pure functions.
- Security: never commit secrets; prefer `config.example.h` and environment variables.
